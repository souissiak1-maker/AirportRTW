# AWDL feasibility and implementation boundaries

Baseline 68f35fa; assessment only. No AWDL capability flags, awdl0 interface,
Apple binary hooks or claims of functional AirDrop are added.

## Observed implementation state

Both Rtw88LinuxBridge and Rtw89LinuxBridge allocate a single station VIF with
NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION and manage a single current AP/station association.
Their scan entry/exit changes receive filters and channel ownership for scanning.
There is no shared AWDL peer table, availability-window scheduler or AWDL data
encapsulation path in these bridges. Sharing one radio between infrastructure
and AWDL requires deliberate channel scheduling and lifecycle arbitration;
reusing scan channel switching without this can disrupt the working AP link.

The local RTL8814Native Source/AirLayer/AWDLInterface.cpp explicitly describes
stage 1: optional role-6 interface creation, queues with no data-path action,
and unsupported AWDL requests. Its README says AirDrop is unavailable. It is
useful as interface/ABI research, not evidence of a working AWDL implementation.
Private symbols and hardcoded layout offsets are version-specific and must not
be copied into our common core without per-target validation and fallback.

## Architecture to preserve

Shared protocol owns peer discovery, synchronization, election, availability
windows, frame validation/encapsulation and teardown. RTWCore exposes optional
radio capabilities; RTWCore88/89 implement hardware-specific operations. Native
Tahoe/Sequoia frontend owns role-6 interface and Skywalk packet queues. No USB
backend, duplicate supplicant, or protocol implementation inside a HAL.

## Staged acceptance gates

1. Radio feasibility: per-HAL management action TX/RX, timestamp precision,
   off-channel duration/switch latency, filtering, secondary MAC/VIF limits,
   STA coexistence, regulatory constraints, cancellation and suspend safety.
   Presence of Linux APIs does not prove these operations work in our bridge.
2. Protocol host tests: bounded AWDL TLV parser, malformed/truncated frames,
   peer lifetime, election/synchronization, availability-window schedule and
   wraparound; use independent captures/specification research as references.
3. Native interface: validated ABI by supported OS, working TX/RX completion,
   ownership and backpressure; clean failure and teardown. Interface creation
   alone is not a feature milestone for AirDrop.
4. Radio discovery and data: peer discovery with actual Apple device, channel
   synchronization, IPv6 neighbor discovery and traffic while STA remains usable.
5. Product validation: bidirectional AirDrop transfers, reconnect, concurrent
   AP traffic, suspend/resume and negative/unplug paths. Advertise support only
   after the implemented path meets these gates.

## Immediate next work

Measure and expose radio capabilities before introducing an active scheduler.
RTL8814Native documents are a useful checklist, but its stage-1 scaffolding does
not fill the missing protocol/data path. PMF audit work is isolated separately
on experiment/rtw88-pmf-audit; neither project depends on enabling flags early.

## Stage 1 implemented: passive shared action-envelope parser

include/AWDL/RTWAwdlFrame.hpp now validates complete unencrypted, unfragmented
802.11 vendor action frames with Apple OUI 00:17:f2, AWDL type 8 and nonzero
version. It walks the 16-byte body header followed by u8/LE16 TLVs with bounded
lengths and no allocation. Unknown/repeated/zero-length TLVs are accepted;
malformed/truncated TLV envelopes are rejected. Contents are not yet decoded
into synchronization, channel scheduling, election or trusted peer state.

The two HAL receive callbacks invoke the same passive observer only in Debug
builds. It adds no TX, off-channel operation, filter change, event-source lock,
virtual interface or packet consumption. Frames retain their existing receive
path. The observer stores no addresses or payloads. Watchdog publication uses
existing controller properties; the sanitized collector explicitly whitelists:
RTWAwdlValidActions, MalformedActions, SyncEnvelopes, ChannelEnvelopes,
LastFrequency, LastVersion and LastSubtype (all prefixed RTWAwdl).

Counters indicate framing only. SyncEnvelopes/ChannelEnvelopes mean a TLV type
was present, not that its body or schedule was semantically valid. Last fields
are best-effort metadata, not a synchronized packet trace. Existing hardware
filters may discard AWDL frames; zero counters do not prove no nearby peer or
lack of hardware support. No monitor/promiscuous mode is enabled for the test.

Host tests cover prefix truncation, invalid envelope/version, oversized TLVs,
unknown/duplicate/zero-length TLVs, protected/fragmented exclusions, observer
counts and 20,000 deterministic randomized buffers under ASAN/UBSAN. Synthetic
framing tests are not Apple-device interoperability or air-capture validation.

  interfaces are not imported into this GPL-2.0/BSD kernel module).

Next gates remain: independent on-air capture validation, per-HAL radio
capability measurement, timing/election/channel handling, native role-6 queue
integration, and bidirectional Apple-device traffic. Stage 1 does not enable
AirDrop, create awdl0, or justify advertising AWDL support.
